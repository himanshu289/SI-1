Welcome to my github repository for the Summer Internship 2024!This project showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with Technologies.

## üöÄ Introduction üöÄ
‚Ä¢ On May 22th, I officially began my internship at Prolog Infotech-Rajkot, that significantly enhanced my web development and project management skills.

‚Ä¢ During this session, new interns like myself were given an overview of the company's core projects and values.

‚Ä¢ The internship program spans 4 weeks,designed to provide hands-on experince and deep insights into the tech industry.

## ‚åõ Internship Progress ‚è≥
‚Ä¢ During the first two weeks of my internship , I focused on learning different technologies, diving deep into their functionalities and applications. This foundational knowledge was crucial for the tasks ahead.

‚Ä¢ After this initial learning phase, I began working on various mini-tasks assigned by the company.

‚Ä¢ In the final week of the internship, I use many websites to create a comprehensive project. This collaborative effort allowed us to integrate everything we had learned and work together to solve complex problems, culminating in a complete and functional project that demonstrated our skills and teamwork.

### Week 1: Setting Up the Landing Page.

‚Ä¢ Created the foundational HTML structure for the BookStop website.

‚Ä¢ Included essential elements: header, navigation links, footer, and sections for home, featured books, categories, deals, reviews, and feedback.

‚Ä¢ Ensured the HTML structure met project requirements for seamless navigation and user interaction.

### Week 2: Styling with CSS

‚Ä¢ Imported Google Fonts (Poppins) and specified font weights to maintain consistent typography throughout the website.

‚Ä¢ Utilized CSS variables to manage global styles such as colors, borders, and box shadows efficiently.
